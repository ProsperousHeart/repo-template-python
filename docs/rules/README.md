## 🎯 Purpose

Rules in this folder ensure:
- Consistent code quality across the project
- Standardized documentation
- Knowledge retention (error KB)
- AI assistant compliance (both Claude and Copilot)

## ✏️ Customization

**This folder is meant to be customized** for your specific project needs:

- Modify docstring standards to match your team's preferences
- Add project-specific error patterns to the KB
- Extend output format for custom reporting needs

## 🤖 AI Assistant Integration

Both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot reference these rules when:
- Generating code (follows docstring standards)
- Creating logs (follows output format)
- Encountering errors (updates and references error KB)
